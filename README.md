# Project Title

rental-property-cash-flow

## Getting Started

App that will implement management of finances for rental property across several owners. This app is implemented using the Spring Framework
and provides a REST API interface and persists underlying data in either derby db (sql) or mongo (nosql) formats. If derby is used, the DB
will be running internal to the Spring application and gets whipped out when the Server restarts. Mongo is persisted on local disk and must
be started externally (mongod).

### Prerequisites
